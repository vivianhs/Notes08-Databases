CIT 114 Notes 8:Databases


## What is a Database?
A database is a shared collection of related data used to support the activities of a particular organization. A database can be viewed as a repository of data that is defined once and then accessed by various users.

A database has the following properties:
It is a representation of some aspect of the real world or a collection of data elements (facts) representing real-world information.
A database is logical, coherent and internally consistent.
A database is designed, built and populated with data for a specific purpose.
Each data item is stored in a field.
A combination of fields makes up a table. For example, each field in an employee table contains data about an individual employee.

### Database Management System
A database management system (DBMS) is a collection of programs that enables users to create and maintain databases and control all access to them. The primary goal of a DBMS is to provide an environment that is both convenient and efficient for users to retrieve and store information.
